    "\n",
    "Monetary compensation is a one of the key factors in employee satisfaction (Card et al., 2012), and studies have shown that working remotely has also positively impacted satisfaction during the pandemic, due to increased autonomy (Galanti et al., 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these two facts, this report aims to provide information regarding salaries and the likelihood of working remotely for each type of job, to people entering the data science job market. This would help them find jobs that match their own hopes and aspirations, as well as create a work environment that is productive in and out of the workplace by influencing work-life balance."

    "\n",
    "In this project, we use the dataset, \"Data Science Job Salaries\", by Ruchi Bhatia (2022) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries). It contains both qualitative and quantitative observations we can harness, like the year the salary was paid, experience level, employment type, title, salary, remote ratio, company size, and company location.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this dataset, our variables of interest are as follows:\n",
    "* ```salary_in_usd``` is our response variable, it uses a single currency (USD) to make comparisons easier regardless of country.\n",
    "* ```job_title``` is one of our explanatory variables; a ```chr``` describing each employee's profession.\n",
    "* ```remote_ratio``` is another explanatory variable; a ```fct``` describing each employee's ratio of remote work (0 = less than 20%, 50 = in between, 100 = greater than 80%)\n",
    "\n",
    "While ```experience_level``` does affect salary, this project is aimed at helping potential employees choose a job, and their own experience level is not something they can select for when job hunting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these variables can help us achieve a more complete picture of the job market in the Data Science field."

To investigate these parameters, we used resampling to investigate their spread (standard deviation) and t-distributions to test our hypotheses. "

    "\n",
    "For the standard deviations, we found that, Data Engineers had a significantly higher standard deviation of salaries than Data Analysts (with 90% confidence), as well as a slightly higher standard deviation of remote work proportions (with 90% confidence). The latter, we have decided, is negligible since the difference is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the difference in mean salaries, we calculated a difference of \\\\$9825.244 - \\\\$31118.71, with a confidence level of 90% and a p-value of 0.1703775%. Given our significance level of 5%, we had enough evidence to reject our first null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for the difference in remote work proportions, we calculated a p-value of 79.18849%, and thus were unable to reject the null hypothesis. This also meant that our 90% confidence interval was not useful, but it centered approximately around 0.\n"

    "\n",
    "Our expectations that the two groups earned different salaries, and that the variations in remote probability were the same came true, but the rest were all false. Instead, we ended up failing to reject the second null hypothesis, and found that Data Engineer salaries had significantly higher standard deviations compared to Data Analysts."

    "\n",
    "From our findings, we can infer that, on average, Data Engineers earned more than Data Analysts, but also that their salaries were a lot more varied in comparison. Their probability of working remotely, however, was roughly equal, with Data Engineers slightly more likely to work from home more than 80% of the time.\n"

This also affects the confidence intervals calculated for the differences in means and proportions. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Moreover, analysis of the industry can be conducted based on this project. This can help us infer what job titles companies view as more valuable, as well as make predictions of how they might react to financial hardship or otherwise changes in a company’s operations (i.e. who gets laid off during a merger, and who is likely to be retained). \n",

    "### Future Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This opens the door for further questions about the difference in experience level, company location and company size when comparing different job titles within the Data Science field. Also, with more data, these questions can be answered for the rest of the jobs that we could not examine due to their sample sizes.\n",

    "We hope further research can be conducted comparing different variables further along with assessment on how salary impacts wellbeing and job satisfaction for both parties (employer and employee) and in multiple industries.\n",

    "Furthermore, we hope that research can be conducted with additional demographic data. For example, a potential question that can be answered with statistical inference is if there is a difference in mean salaries based on race, gender, or other socioeconomic factors. \n",
    "The range of questions can be further broadened and answered within different disciplines, as well, to help employees and employers make smarter decisions and create a better workplace environment for all."
