    "### Background\n",
    "Monetary compensation is a one of the key factors in employees’ response to job satisfaction questions along with education matching the role of an employee (Card et al., 2012; Lee & Sabharwal, 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "This serves as the motivation for this project with the goal being to provide open information about compensation and factors that can contribute to the amount of compensation those in the data science field can expect to receive. While this can be used for monetary gain, the root problem we hope to contribute to using this statistical analysis is to increase workplace satisfaction. At its heart, this project is meant for both employees and employers who can benefit from greater job satisfaction; this can create a work environment that is productive for employees (and employers to a certain extent) in and out of the workplace by influencing work-life balance. \n"

The data was aggregated by ai-jobs.net and contains both qualitative and quantitative observations we can harness: for example, the year the salary was paid, experience level, employment type, title, salary, remote ratio, company size, and company location. Many of these variables are interesting to compare and contrast in the future to get a more complete picture. "
